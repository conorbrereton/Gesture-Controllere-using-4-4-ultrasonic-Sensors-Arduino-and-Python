# Gesture-Controllere-using-4-4-ultrasonic-Sensors-Arduino-and-Python
This is a gesture Controller that uses 4 ultrasonic sensors to control video playback. This gesture Controller Can pause/play a video, rewind/fast forward a video, transform from small screen view to fullscreen view in YouTube, mute a video and turn the volume up and down. The Arduino code stores all the gestures and the python code uses hotkeys to trigger these gestures.
